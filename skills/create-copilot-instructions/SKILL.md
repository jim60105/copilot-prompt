# Create Copilot Instructions

Create or update `AGENTS.md` file for the project.

## Steps

1. Review the documentation at https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot to understand what constitutes a well-crafted `AGENTS.md` or `copilot-instructions.md`.

2. Conduct a thorough examination of the codebase to understand the architecture and stylistic conventions.

3. Check if `AGENTS.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` takes precedence over `AGENTS.md`. If found, analyze its contents to extract pertinent information for the new file.

4. Compose a `AGENTS.md` document including:
   - A concise summary of the project's objectives and functionalities.
   - A clear delineation of coding style and formatting standards.
   - Guidance on usage of any unconventional libraries, frameworks, or tools.
   - Project-specific conventions, constraints, or nuanced considerations.
   - The designated language for in-code annotations and commentary.

5. Create or rewrite the `AGENTS.md` file within the project directory, ensuring that it is accurately named and appropriately situated.
